We can run python3 commands:
 - interactive interpreter: CTRL+D in Linux or Mac, or CTRL+Z  ro exit() on Windows, will be no data saved. 
 - samplefile.py : makes aout code permanent ;
 to run code:
 ***on windows***: type the "just_name_of_the_fil.py"; OS will recognize to run the python. 
 ***on Linux*** : type "python3 file_name.py"
                    or "./file_name.py"
                    or use SheBang and Script. So OS knows this script will be this commant run 


> #!/usr/bin/python
> cat sample.py  


*** to run a command from a file, file must be executable.***

> sudo chmod +x script.py

*** solong a scrip is executabel , we can run it with ./sample.py ***

> ./sample.py
