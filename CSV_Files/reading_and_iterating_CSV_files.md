CSV stands for Comma Separated Values. CSV is a pretty simple format. These files are stored in plaintext. And each line in a CSV file generally represents a single data record. Each field in that record is separated by a comma, with the contents of the field stored between the commas.


Python standard library includes a module which lets us read, create and manipulate CSV files. It s called as ***CSV-module***.

The ***reader()*** function of the CSV module will interpret the file as a CSV.
