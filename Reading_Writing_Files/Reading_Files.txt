Working with huge amainut od data, it would be better getting data from files; not just from variables.
Python gives File_Object.
File_Object con be used to read and write files. 

Example: file=open("siir.txt")

By doing this we have an file_object ans assigning it to a variable called file.
As parameter we gie the name of the file to be opened. 
Hier we assume that we are in the same Directory with the file. 
otherwiese we woul give the absolute or relative PATH.

    readline() method: 
this methods reads the file line by line.
But each time we call the readline() method, 
the file object updates the current position in the file. 
So keeps moving forward. 

    read() method:
this method reads the file form current position until the end of file. 

example: 
    file_obje=open("siir.txt")
    print(file_obje.readline())
    print(file_obje.read())

    close() Method:
Finally we should use close() method to close the file_object.
Because after openingthe file, file would be locked down till the object is ended.
No other program can use it.
And also OS systems can manage some limited number of objeckt.

example:
    file_object.close()


    Using object with "with" 
to avoid forgetting to close the object we use keyword "with"
example:
    with open("siir.txt") as file_object:
        print(file_object.read())

By using with-keyword after reading python would automatically close the object.
Automatically closing at the and of block.
