File System:Operating systems like Mac OS, Windows, and Linux use file systems to organize and control how data is stored and access. 
Data is usually stored on a disk and saved in files which are held in containers called directories or folders. 
File systems are usually organized in a tree structure with directories and files nested under their parents. 

Path: We know where a resource like a directory or a file is located within that tree structure by its path. An absolute path is a full path to the resource in the file system. 
For example, on a Windows computer, the absolute path to the folder for the user Jordan would be C:\Users\Jordan. On a Linux computer, the absolute path to the equivalent directory would be /home/jordan. 
If our current directory is /home/jordan, we'll get the contents of /home/jordan/examples. But if the current directory is /user/share/doc/python3, we'll get the contents of /user/share/doc/python3/examples
